    "# **Introduction:**\n",
    "The landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly evolving with the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), which have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in mimicking human-like text generation and versatility across various applications, including complex problem-solving. The paper \"Can Language Models Solve Graph Problems in Natural Language?\" by Wang et al. explores the potential of LLMs to handle graph-related tasks, traditionally managed with specialized algorithms. This research delves into how well LLMs can interpret, map, and solve graph-based problems using natural language, potentially transforming problem-solving by making it more accessible to a broader audience.\n",
    "#### **Problem Description:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main problem the study aims to investigate is whether large language models (LLMs) can effectively solve structured graph-based problems when presented in natural language, moving beyond simple text generation to more complex, problem-solving tasks. This research addresses a significant challenge in applying AI to real-world problems, as graphs are fundamental in various domains such as social networks and transportation systems. The goal is to make advanced problem-solving accessible to a broader audience without the need for specialized algorithmic knowledge.   \n",
    "\n",
    "This research aims to discover if LLMs can process graph descriptions, map them to accurate conceptual models, and solve graph reasoning tasks using natural language. The researchers main goal was to examine whether LLMs can:\n",
    "- Grasp different natural language descriptions of graphs, identifying nodes, edges, and other elements.\n",
    "- Translate these descriptions into conceptual graph representations that mirror the actual structure and relationships.\n",
    "- Use algorithmic reasoning on these models to address common graph problems, like finding the shortest path or calculating maximum flow.\n",
    "- Understand how LLMs' problem-solving abilities change with task complexity and identify their limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Context of the Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "The exploration into Large Language Models (LLMs) solving graph problems in natural language relies on the foundation of increasing complexity in data structures and the need for more intuitive ways of interacting with such data. Graphs, by their very nature, are a pervasive data structure used across a multitude of disciplines to represent complex relationships and interactions (Chen et. al., 2024). Traditionally, this has required not only a deep understanding of graph theory but also the ability to apply sophisticated algorithmic techniques, often necessitating specialized computational tools and programming expertise. The idea of utilizing LLMs to interpret and solve these problems through natural language represents a shift in how we approach complex problem-solving. This shift is motivated by the goals of accessibility and efficiency (Wang et. al., 2023). On one hand, there's a growing demand for making advanced computational capabilities accessible to a broader audience without the prerequisite of technical expertise in programming or mathematics. On the other hand, the efficiency of solving complex problems through intuitive, natural language interactions presents a compelling case for integrating LLMs into various domains where graph-based problems are prevalent.\n",
    "#### **Limitations of Other Approaches**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Current studies highlight several limitations in applying large language models (LLMs) to graph reasoning tasks. One significant issue is LLMs' inability to perform precise mathematical or complex reasoning, as they were originally designed for text processing, not for explicit problem-solving in structured domains like graphs. Additionally, the research identifies a need for more diverse datasets and notes the diminishing returns of advanced prompting techniques as task complexity increases, underscoring the challenge in enhancing LLMs' effectiveness for complex graph-based problem-solving using natural language. Despite introducing promising prompting strategies like Build-a-Graph and Algorithmic Prompting, Wang et al. (2023) acknowledge that the most complex graph reasoning tasks remain unsolved. Wang et al. (2023) also saw diminishing returns of advanced prompting techniques like chain-of-thought (COT), least-to-most (LTM), and self-consistency (SC) as the complexity of graph reasoning tasks increases. This highlights the ongoing challenge in enabling LLMs to effectively tackle graph problems through natural language, necessitating further research and innovation in this area.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Solution**\n",
    "##### **NLGraph Benchmark**\n",
    "- Comprehensive Testbed: The NLGraph benchmark is a collection of graph-based problems designed in natural language. It covers a wide range of graph reasoning tasks, from simple connectivity queries to complex graph neural network simulations, resulting in a platform for evaluating LLMs' graph reasoning capabilities.\n",
    "- Varied Complexity: The benchmark includes problems of varying complexity, categorized into easy, medium, and hard subsets. This allows for a nuanced analysis of LLMs' performance across different levels of difficulty and task types.\n",
    "- Evaluation Metrics: Beyond binary correctness, the benchmark employs partial credit solutions and exact match accuracy as metrics, enabling a more detailed assessment of LLMs' reasoning processes and solutions.\n",
    "##### **Instruction-based Prompting Techniques**\n",
    "- Build-a-Graph Prompting (BAG): This technique involves instructing the LLM to first construct a mental model of the graph based on the textual description before attempting to solve the problem. It's aimed at encouraging the model to better visualize and understand the graph's structure, enhancing its reasoning ability.\n",
    "- Algorithmic Prompting: Here, the LLM is guided to consider algorithmic steps relevant to solving the specific graph problem at hand. By nudging the model to recall and apply algorithmic logic, this technique seeks to improve the accuracy and depth of the LLM's solutions."

    "In this study we are evaluating the graph reasoning abilities of LLMs, particularly \"davinci-002\" as the original study used \"davinci-003\" as their default LLM (davinci-003 is now depreciated). We are evaluting the LLM across different types of graph problems using specific prompting techniques. This study's methodology introduces and tests a dual prompting system where, Build-a-Graph Prompting helps LLMs visualize and structure the problem contextually before solving it, while Algorithmic Prompting introduces algorithmic thinking by outlining steps relevant to the graph problem at hand. This approach is tested across various graph reasoning tasks such as hamilton path, cycles, and shortest paths to evaluate its effectiveness with accuracy. We will be comparing both techniques with standard Chain-of-Thought method. Both prompting techniques are designed to enhance the capabilities of LLMs by providing them with additional context and structured thinking paths. Below you will find more information about the different techniques and tasks.\n",

With this technique we append a instruction such as \"Let's construct a graph with the nodes and edges first\" right after the textual description of the graph. The idea is that by first visualizing or conceptualizing the graph structure, the language model can better understand and prepare for the problem-solving process that follows. \n",

    "Algorithmic Prompting, on the other hand, involves revisiting and reflecting on the algorithmic steps needed for solving a graph-related task. Before presenting the main problem, we introduce details about relevant algorithms, such as Depth-First Search (DFS) for finding paths or detecting cycles in graphs. The prompt would start with a line like \"We can use a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to find the shortest path between two given nodes in an undirected graph.\"\n",

It's a fundamental problem with applications in routing, navigation, and network optimization. For the Shortest Path, models were prompted to calculate paths based on edge weights. This task in the NLGraph benchmark checks if language models can find the most efficient connection or pathway between points in a graph when described in natural language, mimicking real-world routing problems.  \n",

    "Q: Is there a path in this graph that visits every node exactly once? If yes, give the path. Note that in a path, adjacent nodes must be connected with edges.  \n",
    "A: Yes. We can start at node 0. As node 0 is connected with node 1, and node 1 is not visited, we can then visit node 1.  \n",

    "The cycle.py and other task scripts play a crucial role in our evaluation process by configuring and running experiments to assess the ability of various language models to identify cycles in undirected graphs. The script initializes by configuring command-line arguments for selecting the model, difficulty level, and prompting techniques. It uses these configurations to dynamically generate graph-related queries. Using networkx, a library for the creation, manipulation, and study of complex networks, the script constructs graph instances. It then formats these instances into natural language prompts that ask whether a cycle exists within the graph, tailored according to the specified prompting technique. Leveraging OpenAI's API, the script sends these prompts to the specified language model and retrieves the responses. Responses are collected, and the script determines the accuracy of each model's cycle detection based on the answers. Results, along with other relevant data, are logged to a file for later analysis. It processes graphs in batches to efficiently manage memory and computation.  \n"

    "\n",
    "## **Results**\n",
    "In our results, we observed distinct variations in performance across different prompting methods applied to graph reasoning tasks from Figure A above. For the Cycles task, the Build-a-Graph (BAG) and Algorithmic methods showed notable improvements over the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) method. Specifically, BAG and Algorithmic outperformed CoT by 6.45% at the medium difficulty level, and 13.57% and 15%, respectively, at the hard difficulty level. In the Hamilton Path task, BAG significantly enhanced performance by 80% over CoT at the easy level, whereas Algorithmic showed a more modest improvement of 20.12%. Notably, for the Shortest Path task, BAG and Alg did not consistently outperform CoT, especially at the easy level where both showed a 12.39% decrease in performance compared to CoT. However, BAG alone showed marginal improvement in the hard level with a 0.5% increase, the only method to record a correct answer in this category. These results underscore the potential of specialized prompting techniques like BAG and Alg in improving the reasoning capabilities of language models on complex graph-based tasks, particularly in scenarios requiring higher-order thinking and structured problem-solving approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "In comparing the results of our study to the original investigation into the efficacy of prompting methods on graph-based tasks, we observed some similarties. The original study reported a performance improvement ranging from 3.07% to 16.85% for easier tasks like cycles and shortest paths when utilizing Build-a-Graph (BAG) and Algorithmic (Alg) prompting methods. Our findings align with these observations, particularly for the Cycles task, where we noted improvements up to 15% in the hard category and 6.45% in the medium category. Similarly, for the Hamilton Path task, we found a substantial increase of up to 80% at the easy level using BAG, significantly exceeding the gains reported in the original study.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Learnings**  \n",
    "Learnt the importance of natural language prompting when working with LLMs. Learnt about the proposed BAG and Algorithmic methods, and how they improve performance in certain graph reasoning tasks. We also learnt that Diminishing returns of advanced prompting methods with increasing task complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Limitations/Future Direction** \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the primary limitations identified in our study, mirroring concerns from the original research, is the diminishing returns of advanced prompting techniques as task complexity increases. Furthermore we also had a limitation for financial constraints, as the use of LLM APIs involves considerable costs, which restricted the breadth and depth of experiments we could conduct.Future research should focus on developing more sophisticated prompting techniques and making LLMs robust against misleading correlations in problem settings. Additionally, expanding the NLGraph benchmark and integrating interdisciplinary approaches could enhance the models' effectiveness and applicability in solving complex graph-based problems in real-world scenarios."
